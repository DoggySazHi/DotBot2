    <header>About Me</header>
    <p>I'm William Le, a programmer, I guess. Currently, I am a CSE major at UC Merced, class of 2025. I graduated from Troy High School (class of 2021) through the Troy Tech program.</p>
    <p>Most projects I do are for fun, learning different programming languages and frameworks.</p>
    <p>I specialize in C# and Java, however I have experience with web development, machine learning, and normal applications.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>I have previously interned with DeltaOne software and as of August 2022, am currently interning with Walpole ITS.</p>
